## Goals

* Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Portugese Bank Marketing dataset ([UCI][1], [kaggle][2]).
* Classification goal of predicting whether or not a customer will subscribe a term deposit.

## Info

* This was a group project part of the course "DSA5101: Introduction to Big Data for Industry". I did the EDA and pre-processing bits.
* I've also included some models to demo performance. A more thorough study of different models and parameters was performed by the other members.
* The presentation also included discussions of the business implication, insights and findings, and future ideas. I'll not be updating the slides here.
* Please download the dataset from the links provided. I'll not be uploading the csv files here.
